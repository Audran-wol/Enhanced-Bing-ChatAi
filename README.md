New ♾️ Bing ChatAI Extensions: Making Bing ChatAI Easier to Use

Bing ChatAI is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, including customer service, education, and entertainment. However, it can be difficult to use Bing ChatAI effectively when you are constantly scrolling up and down to find the information you need, or when you are limited in the length of the inputs you can type.

That's why we're excited to announce the release of the new Bing ChatAI extensions! These extensions make Bing ChatAI easier to use by preventing accidental scrolling and increasing the input character limit.
